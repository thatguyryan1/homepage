        <h1>Dracula is a film series of horror films from Universal Pictures based on the 1897 novel Dracula by Bram Stoker and its 1927 play adaptation. The series is a loose collection of films, with historians stating that the films all reference characters, events or at least passing knowledge of the 1931 English-language production of Dracula, with historians noting that Dracula's Daughter and Son of Dracula are more closely related to the 1931 film while the character of Dracula would make smaller appearances in later films such as House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula. After Dracula's Daughter, the character of Dracula and other vampires in the series became more Americanized starting with the release of Son of Dracula, and the later House of films.[1] The character of Dracula appears in all the films outside of Dracula's Daughter, where he is portrayed by Bela Lugosi (Dracula, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein), Lon Chaney Jr. (Son of Dracula), and John Carradine in the House of films..</h1>
