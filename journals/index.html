        <h1>Entry 1 - Shifting House And A Rant On Technology</h1>
        <p>I feel like the reason technology is so associated with things that are considered high-tech is because simpler stuff such as a book or as mentioned lighting a fire is stuff that has been around for ages. That doesn’t take away from the fact that they are still technological advancements though, they just so happened to be created way before we were born which is why we don’t associate them as technology sometimes. Same could be said though for modern day technology as in the far future they won’t be considered high-tech anymore. Another thing I realized a little bit later after writing this is that the same is with coding as well because new languages are always being created.
            As for the other reading the explanation of creating the work as well as the world, that is part of the reason I am doing a computer science minor as I feel like being able to create the functioning apps/website as well design the looks of them is what i'm hoping for when combing my major and minor. It was also interesting to see the comparison to objects.

        <h1>Entry 2 - Handmade Web</h1>
        <p>Handmade webs definitely feel more personal as mentioned in the writing, it isn’t so cookie cutter and easily mass produced which is why a lot of websites that run on website creator websites such as Squarespace don’t feel unique. Because of this, a piece of personality that once was shown by these handmade websites are no longer there. Just like everything else, I believe that these website generators will eventually become obsolete though as eventually I believe ai might be able to do everything but unlike handmade webs which will still feel personal, these squarespace websites will be no different from the entirely ai generated ones.</p>

        <h1>Entry 3 - "Hello World"</h1>
        <p>The illustrations that go along with the reading make it very easy to understand compared to some of the previous readings. I also liked the reference to some coding/computer terms such as the world not simply being 1’s and 0’s which are basically on and off/yes or no statements. It means that the world can’t be simply created in a computer as the world is full of unknown factors where a computer can only do what it is designed to do. It also made me realize that something that I may understand doesn’t mean the computer will understand as computers can’t think for themselves really (unless ai keeps improving). Side note - I never really got why "Hello world" is the commmon phrase used when learning coding, was it like the first thing said by an important program or something?</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Entry 4 - A Friend is writing</h1>
        <p>The first thing besides texting that this website reminded me of was the help chat functions that would be used on some websites to seek help from customer service (something I’ve never used). This website definitely seems to target the same feeling of anxiety that can be caused by texting as the constant loud notifications and the waiting speech bubble that appears can be frustrating at times having to wait for the rest of the reading. I will say it is probably the most unique experience of reading we have had in this class. Something I didn’t realize at first was the changing of profile pictures in the same readings which makes me wonder are these supposed to be group chats or private conversations with one person?</p>

        <h1>Entry 5 - Damon Zucconi, Debt, 2017</h1>
        <p>Just like last entry too, Debt seems to also deal with modern day texting but in a different way. While it is stated that Debt is about the errors that people make, instead gives off a feeling of the same conversation happening daily with slight changes or how people may spell the same words differently when using texting terminology. It almost feels like each version is an alternate reality where the same conversation is taking place but slight changes in their lives has led to these different spellings. I would not be surprised if AI is able to do this exact same thing too as it almost feels like an AI generation of what a texting conversation may look like in modern times. </p>
